        Jimmy Butler has been arguably the best basketball player this postseason. Coming into the playoffs the Miami Heat were the 7th-seeded team in the Eastern Conference and had been very disappointing all season as the year prior they were the best team in the East and 1 win away from the NBA Finals. Through the NBA <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35805161/nba-play-tournament-2023-schedule-projections-standings" target="_blank">Play-in Tournament</a>, the Heat had dropped down to the 8th seed and most fans and sports betting odds had counted the team out and predicted that they would lose to the 1st-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in either 4 or 5 games. This is where Jimmy and Heat proved everyone wrong, as a team they turned it up on the offensive side and defensive side of the court. The Heat were shooting at a very high rate from the field and the three while playing the best defense of the postseason and it all started with Jimmy. Jimmy played the best the series of his 12 years in the NBA as he averaged nearly 38 points on 60% shooting while playing against the 3 of the best defenders in the NBA Jrue Holiday, a player that made 1st team All-Defense this year, Brook Lopez, another player that made 1st team All-Defense this year, and Giannis Antentokounmpo, a past winner of NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year. Jimmy has also been just as impressive on the defensive end and playmaking as he always limits the players he’s defending and is looking for ways to make his teammates better too. Through Jimmy’s leadership, the Miami Heat have defied all odds and were the first 8th seed to make a Conference Finals and are now 1 win away from reaching the NBA Finals as they were given only a 3% chance of winning the series and are now up 3-0 on the 2nd-seeded Boston Celtics.

    <p> <!--Explanation with links to explain triple doubles, pick and rolls, and a video showcasin Jokic's weaknesses-->
        Nikola Jokic, the reigning 2 times MVP, has been spectacular in these playoffs. He's been leading the 1st seeded Denver Nuggets past every opponent easily as the Nuggets have made the NBA finals after beating the Los Angeles Lakers 4-0. Jokic has arguably been the best passer and playmaker these playoffs as he's averaging over 10 assists a game. On top of 10 assists per game, he's passed Wilt Chamberlin for most <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/triple-double-basketball" target="_blank">Triple Doubles</a> in a postseason with a total of 8 times. Jokic has been efficient shooting the basketball and has improved his greatest weakness which was his defense. In the past, the biggest criticism of Jokic was his below-average defense where teams would attack him on a <a href="https://www.basketballforcoaches.com/pick-and-roll/" target="_blank">Pick and Roll</a> and be able to score easy wide-open layups due to running right past Jokic. This video here shows some of his past weaknesses: <a href="https://youtu.be/oEGBNR1AlhA" target="_blank">Nikola Jokic Bad Defense</a>.<br>In this year's playoffs and regular season Jokic has been perfectly fine as he’s gotten in better shape to be able to keep up with quicker players and improved on how he can use his height and wingspan to disrupt passes and shots. Jokic has been great this year as he’s been very efficient while shooting shots, whether it be threes or twos and his improved defense has helped Denver become a great defensive team.

    <p> <!--Explains why Devin Booker should be on the list and has links to explain what true shooting percentage is and show Kevin Durant's stats-->
        The last player on the list Devin Booker could have been even higher on the list if looking at his efficiency and points however, due to being eliminated in the second round I couldn't find myself putting him higher over the first two players. Coming into the playoffs the 4th-seeded Phoenix Suns had championship expectations as they had acquired <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a>, a top 10 NBA player, at the trade tradeline. In the regular season, the Suns went 8-0 so the expectations were at the very least to reach the NBA Finals but, in the playoffs their weaknesses started to come out as the team lacked depth and relied too heavily on Devin Booker and Kevin Durant. Through both the rounds Devin Booker played he was putting on a show for NBA fans to enjoy, his performances were HISTORIC. Booker is a player that shoots tough shots like mid ranges where he's moving or threes so, having a 60% shooting percentage was unprecedented. His offense was like nothing ever seen before, his midrange game was very similar to that of NBA legends like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. His <a href="https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/true-shooting-percentage/" target="_blank">True Shooting Percentage</a> was 70% while the league average in the playoffs is around 55% in the playoffs. Aside from offense, Booker just like Jokic became a highly improved defender as he too was regarded as a bad defender years priors. Booker was sensational against the Los Angeles Clippers in Round 1 as he averaged 2.6 steals and 1 block a game.
